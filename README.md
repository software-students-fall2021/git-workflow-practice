[Interesting Vid] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_BNaUmVulo&ab_channel=Insider)

<p> I was one day surfing on the web when I stumbled across this video about Pixar and all the software they used to enhance their movies as well as solve problems in their animation.
    One interesting thing I learned watching this video was how each of these individual softwares that solved one or maybe two problems took years to create. Like how they took three years to work 
    on a simulator powerful enough to simulate Merida's bouncy hair in the movie <em>Brave</em>. They also had to adjust gravity, and shadowing in order to make the hair more realistic which in turn would
    be used in their later films as well. At first glance, trying to create hair seems very easy, if you say it out loud. But easier said than done. I'm in marvel at the different skills and practical
    solutions they used to simulate something that seemed very complicated to make and process, which it was since it took 3 years.</p>
